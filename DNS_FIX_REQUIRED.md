---

## üîß How to Fix (Required Steps)

You need to add DNS records at your **domain registrar** (where you bought `lalith.live`).

### Azure IP Address: `13.75.76.44`

---

## Step 1: Login to Your Domain Registrar

Go to the website where you purchased `lalith.live` (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)

---

## Step 2: Add These DNS Records

### **A Record (Root Domain)**

| Type | Name/Host | Value/Points To | TTL |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| A    | @ or (blank) | `13.75.76.44` | 3600 |

This makes `lalith.live` point to your Azure site.

---

### **CNAME Record (WWW Subdomain)**

| Type | Name/Host | Value/Points To | TTL |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| CNAME | www | `ambitious-pond-0a5877700.2.azurestaticapps.net` | 3600 |

This makes `www.lalith.live` redirect to your site.

---

### **TXT Record (Domain Verification) - If Required**

Some registrars require domain verification. If Azure asked for this:

| Type | Name/Host | Value | TTL |
|------|-----------|-------|-----|
| TXT | @ or _dnsauth | (Value provided by Azure during setup) | 3600 |

---

## Step 3: Remove Any Conflicting Records

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Remove any existing A or CNAME records for:
- `@` (root domain)
- `www`

These might conflict with your new records.

---

## Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation

- **Typical Time:** 1-4 hours
- **Maximum Time:** 24-48 hours

### Check DNS Propagation:

Use these tools to verify your DNS is propagating:

1. **DNS Checker:** https://dnschecker.org/
   - Enter: `lalith.live`
   - Should show: `13.75.76.44`

2. **Command Line Check:**
   ```powershell
   nslookup lalith.live
   ```
   Should return: `13.75.76.44`

---

## Step 5: Update Site Configuration (After DNS Works)

Once DNS is working, update your site's URL in the code:

**File:** `src/pages/index.tsx`

Change line 25 from:
```typescript
url: "https://lalith-portfolio.azurestaticapps.net",
```

To:
```typescript
url: "https://lalith.live",
```

Then rebuild and redeploy:
```powershell
npm run build
npm run export
# Then deploy to Azure
```
